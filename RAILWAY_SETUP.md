âœ… **Code updated to use environment variables:**
- Unsubscribe links now use `SUBSCRIPTION_BASE_URL` env var
- Port automatically uses Railway's `PORT` env var
- Falls back to local config for development

âœ… **Package.json updated:**
- Added `start` script for Railway deployment

âœ… **Documentation created:**
- Full guide: `docs/setup/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Deploy Now (5 Minutes)

### 1. Push to GitHub

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Wait for deployment (~2-3 minutes)

### 3. Configure
1. In Railway dashboard â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Networking** â†’ **Generate Domain**
2. Copy your URL (e.g., `https://sira-newsletter-production.up.railway.app`)
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add variable:

## Environment Variables

Set these in Railway's **Variables** tab:

| Variable | Value | Required |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `SUBSCRIPTION_BASE_URL` | Your Railway app URL | âœ… Yes |
| `PORT` | (Auto-set by Railway) | Auto |

## Local Development

Your local setup still works! The code checks for environment variables first, then falls back to `config.json`:

```javascript
// Checks in this order:
1. process.env.SUBSCRIPTION_BASE_URL
2. config.json â†’ subscription.baseUrl
3. http://localhost:3001 (default)
```
