# Documentation Organization Guide

This document explains how the documentation is organized to help AI assistants and developers quickly understand the SIRA Newsletter project.

## 🎯 Purpose

All documentation has been organized into the `docs/` folder with a clear structure that:
- **Helps AI models** quickly understand project context via `.cursorrules`
- **Guides new users** with logical categorization
- **Improves discoverability** through clear naming and indexing
- **Maintains clarity** by separating concerns (setup vs guides vs architecture)

## 🤖 AI Assistant Integration

### .cursorrules File

The `.cursorrules` file at the project root provides:
- **Quick project overview** - What the system does
- **Tech stack summary** - Key technologies used
- **Entry points** - Where to start reading documentation
- **Common patterns** - Development guidelines
- **Quick reference** - Most-used commands and paths

This file is automatically read by Cursor and AI assistants to understand the project context immediately.

### Key Files for AI Context

When an AI assistant opens this project, it should read (in order):

1. **`.cursorrules`** - High-level project understanding
2. **`README.md`** - User-facing overview and quick start
3. **`docs/README.md`** - Complete documentation index
4. **`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Technical architecture
5. **`config.json`** - Current configuration

## 📋 Category Descriptions

### Setup (`docs/setup/`)
Files related to **installing, configuring, and getting started** with the project. If someone is setting up the system for the first time, they should start here.

**Key files:**
- `START_HERE.md` - First file to read
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` - Step-by-step setup
- `OLLAMA_SETUP.md` - Local AI setup

### Guides (`docs/guides/`)
**How-to documentation** for specific tasks and features. These are practical guides for users who already have the system running.

**Key files:**
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Command cheat sheet
- `SUBSCRIBER_MANAGEMENT.md` - Managing email lists

### Architecture (`docs/architecture/`)
**Technical documentation** explaining how the system works internally. For developers who want to understand or modify the codebase.

**Key files:**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and components
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Project goals and approach

### Changelog (`docs/changelog/`)
**Historical records** of changes, updates, and fixes. Documents what has been built and modified over time.

**Key files:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `LATEST_UPDATES.md` - Recent changes

## 🔍 Finding Documentation

### By User Type

**New User?**
→ `docs/setup/START_HERE.md` → `docs/setup/GETTING_STARTED.md`

**Existing User?**
→ `docs/guides/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` → `docs/guides/`

**Developer?**
→ `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/architecture/`

**Troubleshooting?**
→ `README.md` (Troubleshooting section) → `docs/setup/`

### By Topic

| Topic | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Installation | `docs/setup/SETUP.md` |
| Gmail Setup | `README.md` (Gmail Setup section) |
| Ollama (local AI) | `docs/setup/OLLAMA_SETUP.md` |
| Subscribers | `docs/guides/SUBSCRIBER_MANAGEMENT.md` |
| Email Templates | `docs/guides/FOOTER_CONFIG.md` |
| System Design | `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Commands | `docs/guides/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` |
| Recent Changes | `docs/changelog/LATEST_UPDATES.md` |

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Maintainers

1. **New setup docs** → `docs/setup/`
2. **New how-to guides** → `docs/guides/`
3. **Architecture changes** → Update `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. **Version updates** → Add to `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md`
5. **Breaking changes** → Update both `README.md` and relevant docs

### For AI Assistants

When helping users:
1. **Always check** `.cursorrules` first for project context
2. **Reference** `docs/README.md` for complete documentation map
3. **Point users** to specific documentation files rather than explaining everything
4. **Update** documentation when code changes are made
5. **Maintain** consistent paths when referencing files

### For Contributors

- Keep `README.md` focused on quick start and overview
- Put detailed guides in `docs/guides/`
- Document architectural decisions in `docs/architecture/`
- Log significant changes in `docs/changelog/`
- Always update the relevant documentation when making code changes
