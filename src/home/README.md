## Database Integration
Signups are automatically saved to `data/subscribers.db` using the existing subscriber management system. All subscribers have:

- Unsubscribe token
- Subscription status tracking

## Deployment
For production deployment (e.g., Railway):
1. Set `HOME_PORT` environment variable (or use default 3002)
2. Ensure `data/` directory exists and is writable
3. Run `npm run home`

The server includes graceful shutdown handling for SIGTERM/SIGINT signals.
