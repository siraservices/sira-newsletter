**What Changed:**

  "email": {
    "companyName": "Aira Development, LLC",

  }
}
```

## Testing Your Changes

### 1. Send a Test Email

```bash
npm run test-send
```

This will send an email to your configured test recipient with:
- The new professional footer
- Working unsubscribe link
- All legal disclaimers

### 2. Test the Unsubscribe Link

1. Open the test email in your inbox
2. Scroll to the footer
3. Click "Unsubscribe" or "Update Your Preferences"
4. Verify it opens your email client with the pre-filled unsubscribe request

### 3. Preview the Footer

```bash
npm run preview
```

Then navigate to the preview server to see how the footer looks in your browser.

## Customization

### Change Company Information

Edit `config.json`:
```json
{
  "email": {
    "companyName": "Your Company Name",
    "companyAddress": "Your Full Address Here"
  }
}
```

### Modify Legal Disclaimers

Edit the footer sections in:
- `src/email/templates/newsletter.hbs` (lines 95-111)
- `src/email/templates/newsletter-hormozi.hbs` (lines 26-42)

### Change Footer Styling

All styles are inline (required for email clients). Common changes:

```html
<!-- Font size -->
<p style="font-size: 12px;">

<!-- Text color -->
<p style="color: #666666;">

<!-- Spacing -->
<p style="margin: 16px 0 0 0;">
```

## Legal Compliance

Your newsletter footer now includes:

### ✅ CAN-SPAM Act Requirements:
1. Physical mailing address
2. Clear unsubscribe mechanism
3. Accurate from/sender information

### ⚠️ Manual Steps Required:
1. **Honor unsubscribe requests** - Remove users from your list within 10 days
2. **Keep records** - Track who unsubscribed and when
3. **Don't share unsubscribe emails** - Don't sell or transfer to third parties

## How to Handle Unsubscribes

### When You Receive an Unsubscribe Email:

1. **Note the email address** from the sender
2. **Remove from config.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "email": {
       "recipients": [
         "user@example.com"  // Remove this line
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Send confirmation** (optional but recommended):
   - Reply confirming they've been unsubscribed
   - Thank them for being a subscriber

4. **Keep a record:**
   - Create a separate list of unsubscribed emails
   - Don't re-add them in the future

### Future Automation Options

For larger lists, consider:
- **Email service providers** - Mailchimp, SendGrid, ConvertKit (handle unsubscribes automatically)
- **Web-based unsubscribe page** - Hosted form that removes users from a database
- **API integration** - Automated webhook to remove users when they click unsubscribe

## Troubleshooting

### Unsubscribe Link Doesn't Open Email Client

**Possible causes:**
- No default email client configured
- User is on webmail only (Gmail, Outlook.com)
- Link is blocked by email client

**Solutions:**
- Test in different email clients
- Consider adding a web-based unsubscribe option
- Ensure the mailto: link is properly formatted

### Footer Not Displaying Correctly

**Check:**
1. Config values are set correctly
2. Templates were saved properly
3. Clear any email client cache
4. Test in multiple email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)

### Missing Company Info in Footer

**Verify:**
```bash
# Check your config
cat config.json
```

Should show:
```json
"companyName": "Your Company Name",
"companyAddress": "Your Address"
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test thoroughly** - Send test emails to yourself
2. ✅ **Customize disclaimers** - Adjust legal text as needed for your use case
3. ✅ **Update company info** - Add your real company details
4. ✅ **Document your process** - Write down how you'll handle unsubscribes
5. ⚠️ **Consider legal review** - Have a lawyer review your disclaimers if needed
